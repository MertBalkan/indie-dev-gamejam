In this Icy Tower inspired platformer game, you play as a snail who has a tape-measure back instead of a shell.  
With the tape it can grab on platforms and move up quickly. But be careful! If you miss the platform the tape measure recoils swiftly, retracts back into its casing and hits you. 
You can also use the tape as a sword against the enemies you encounter during your journey up to the sky.
(nvm it doesn't work we couldnt finish this part :'))
